    post: `Earth Day is a celebration of our planet and a reminder that we must take collective action to protect our environment. DoorDash’s mission is to empower local economies, and we have the opportunity to support merchants, Dashers and customers in the transition to a more sustainable future. Earlier this week, we released our 2021 Environmental, Social, and Corporate Governance (ESG) report with information about our carbon footprint and how we’re working to avoid, reduce and remove emissions. This Earth Day, we’re excited to share more details on efforts to broaden access to e-bikes and packaging alternatives. 

    Increasing Access to E-Bikes to Help Decrease Emissions
    
    Improving the way goods are delivered is key to building a more sustainable future. 
    
    For Dashers in New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco, New Jersey, Chicago and Philadelphia, we’re partnering with Zoomo to make it easier to access e-bikes. For a limited time, Zoomo is offering e-bikes for free the first two weeks, waiving the starter fee, and covering the cost of theft protection for the first week. For Dashers in New York City and San Francisco, we’re also offering a “$30 for 30 deliveries” cash bonus for Dashers who deliver via bike or e-bike.`,

    post: `DoorDash (NYSE: DASH), the leading on-demand delivery platform, today introduced express grocery delivery, a new service that offers consumers faster and more convenient delivery of fresh groceries in under 30 minutes*, in partnership with Albertsons Companies (NYSE: ACI), one of the nation’s leading food and drug retailers. As part of this launch, consumers in more than 20 major cities across the U.S., including Los Angeles, Denver, Seattle and more, will now be able to access express grocery delivery from their local Albertsons Cos. banner stores including Safeway, Vons, ACME Markets, Jewel-Osco, and Tom Thumb in 30 minutes or less via the DoorDash marketplace. DoorDash plans to expand this offering to additional Albertsons Cos. banners in the coming weeks.

    Albertsons Cos. will offer more than 6,000 items for express grocery delivery nationwide, from key grocery staples including fresh produce, dairy, and eggs, to snacks, packaged goods, and frozen foods. Whether customers are midway through cooking dinner and missing a fresh ingredient, or are simply craving a late night snack, shoppers can now access express delivery from Albertsons Cos. on the DoorDash app. DoorDash customers can enjoy Albertsons Cos. loyalty pricing and promotions on express grocery orders where available, and Albertsons Cos. local banner loyalty program members, such as Albertsons for U and Safeway for U, can choose to link their account in the DoorDash app to earn loyalty points on purchases.`,

    post: `Many of us are in the midst of the 2021 Annual Performance Cycle and having ongoing conversations about how to better unlock and support our employees and teams. Knowing that inclusion is one of the foundational elements of highly engaged and effective teams, it’s also a great time to reflect on DoorDash’s value of Making Room at the Table. But what does inclusion really mean and why does it matter? As a leader, how do you help to build inclusion and truly make room at the table?

    Studies show that inclusive environments increase trust and collaboration and drive innovation. When employees feel included they also perform at higher levels and stay at the company longer. At DoorDash, we define inclusion as the act of being included in a system or structure. Inclusion is created in policies, procedures, social norms, language and word choice, etc. Put another way, inclusion is the degree to which organizations embrace all employees and enable them to make meaningful contributions.`,
